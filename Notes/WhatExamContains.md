    OPEN BOOK (DO NOT USE ANY AI EXTENSIONS AND NO GOOGLE OR AI)
        - if you are using my notes for this exam, make sure to download them to avoid any complications with prof (plz)
    
    Will be given a question and will have to code an algorithm accordingly
    There will also be MCQs
    And more complexity calc again
    Coding will be on your own computer and then will be submitted on Teams Fourm (more details below)
    
    There will be a forum on Teams, that will contain the MCQs and it is also where you will submit the code
        (Copy and paste your code from VS code to the forum)
        DO NOT SUBMIT THE FOURM YOURSELF -> CALL THE PROF FIRST THEN ONCE IT IS OK, SUBMIT WITH HIS PERMISSION


Homework will help a bit in the final mark: (Extra marks)

    - If done on time, it will help bump up  (eg 2.3 overall then due to homework 2.0 or 1.7 (depending on how much you have done))
    - if done late, it will bump up but not as significantly
    - if not done, it will not deduct marks

Exams will be conducted as following
    
    - Group 1 (Wednsday batch) -> 3rd of July       Written then Oral
    - Group 2 (Monday Batch)   -> 1st of August     Oral then Written
    If you want to take the exam at a later or earlier date (during one of the dates above) then your group
    it is possible to do so, you just have to ask the prof before the 1st of July
