Oral:
    NOT OPEN BOOK
    time and space complexity in snippet of code given:
        - Big O
        - Big theta
        - Big omega

    The Oral will Contain:
        - all of non-linear
        - all of sorting
        - (a test to show understanding of concepts)
    
    will be in groups (2 each)
    15mins per group

Written:
    OPEN BOOK (DO NOT USE ANY AI EXTENSIONS AND NO GOOGLE OR AI)
    will be given a question and will have to code an algorithim accordingly
    There will also be mcqs
    And more complexity calc again
    on own computer then will be sent

Homeworks will help a bit in final mark:
    - If done on time it will help bump up  (eg 2.3 overall then due to homeworks 2.0 or 1.7 (depends on how much you have done))
    - if done late will bump up but not as significantly
    - if not done will not deducte marks
