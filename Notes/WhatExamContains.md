Oral:
    NOT OPEN BOOK

    The Oral will Contain:
        - Explaining the concept and steps of an algo in a snippet of code given
        - Expalining time and space complexity in snippet of code given:
            - Big O
            - Big theta     (ALL BIG NOTATION WILL BE ASKED FOR EACH TIME AND SPACE)
            - Big omega
        - all of non-linear
        - all of sorting
        - (a test to show understanding of concepts)
    
    will be in groups (2 each [will be chosen by prof])
    15mins per group

Written:
    OPEN BOOK (DO NOT USE ANY AI EXTENSIONS AND NO GOOGLE OR AI)
    will be given a question and will have to code an algorithim accordingly
    There will also be mcqs
    And more complexity calc again
    on own computer then will be sent

Homeworks will help a bit in final mark:
    - If done on time it will help bump up  (eg 2.3 overall then due to homeworks 2.0 or 1.7 (depends on how much you have done))
    - if done late will bump up but not as significantly
    - if not done will not deducte marks
