Oral: 50%

    NOT OPEN BOOK

    The Oral Will Contain:
        - Explaining the concept and steps of an algo in a snippet of code given
        - Explaining time and space complexity in the snippet of code given:
            - Big O
            - Big theta     (ALL BIG NOTATION WILL BE ASKED FOR EACH TIME AND SPACE)
            - Big omega
        - all of non-linear (addition self taught topics: ternary tree and Kruskal's algo)
        - all of sorting
        - (a test to show understanding of concepts)
    
    It will be in groups (2 each [will be chosen by prof])
    10 to 15 mins per group

Written: 50%

    OPEN BOOK (DO NOT USE ANY AI EXTENSIONS AND NO GOOGLE OR AI)
        - if you are using my notes for this exam, make sure to download them to avoid any complications with prof (plz)
    
    Written exam will contain:
        - Will be given multiple coding questions that will need to be answered with the proper algorithm(s) 
        - There will be MCQs (multiple choice questions)
        - Time and Space complexity calculations with the Big Notations
        - All of these will be about all of the topics and the subtopics we have taken in class.
                        (addition self taught topics: ternary tree and Kruskal algo)

    Coding will be on your own computer and then will be submitted on Teams Form (more details below)
    
    There will be a form on Teams, that will contain the MCQs and it is also where you will submit the code
        (Copy and paste your code from VS code to the form)
        DO NOT SUBMIT THE FORM YOURSELF -> CALL THE PROF FIRST THEN ONCE IT IS OK, SUBMIT WITH HIS PERMISSION


Homework will help a bit in the final mark: (Extra marks)

    - If done on time, it will help bump up  (eg 2.3 overall then due to homework 2.0 or 1.7 (depending on how much you have done))
    - if done late, it will bump up but not as significantly
    - if not done, it will not deduct marks

Exams will be conducted as following
    
    - Group 1 (Wednesday batch) -> 3rd of July       Written then Oral
    - Group 2 (Monday Batch)   -> 1st of August      Oral then Written

        (Requests for changing the dates have now been officially closed [no more requests will be approved])
    If you want to take the exam at a later or earlier date (during one of the dates above) then your group
    it is possible to do so, you just have to ask the prof before the 1st of July
