'''
Non-Linear Data Structures are data structures with multiple branches (like a tree[foreshadowing]),
they use a hierarchy to sort (on multiple levels[branches]). Uses classes and objects 

- Trees
    They work on nodes, different nodes on different/multiple levels. some nodes are
        - Parent nodes 
            They are the nodes that give access to the next level (to their children)
        - Child Nodes
            They are the nodes 

    Each tree consists of a root node and sub trees - children and parents.
    A node consits of the data inside it and its child nodes.

    Basic operations of Tree Structures:
        - Create -> creating a tree in the data structure
        - Insert -> Inserts data into the tree
        - Search -> Searches the tree to find data
        - Travesrse ->
